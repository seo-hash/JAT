/**
 * Root Layout Component
 *
 * This is the root layout for the entire Next.js application.
 * It wraps all pages and provides:
 * - Global metadata (SEO, Open Graph, Twitter cards)
 * - Clerk authentication provider
 * - Global providers (React Query, Theme, Toast)
 * - Global styles and fonts
 *
 * Key Concepts:
 * - Layouts in Next.js are shared UI that persist across page navigations
 * - Root layout is required and wraps all pages
 * - Metadata is used for SEO and social media sharing
